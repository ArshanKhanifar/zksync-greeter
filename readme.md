### Interacting with the contract 
The `scripts/check.ts` script will interact with the contract. 

Run it with 

```
yarn hardhat run scripts/check.ts
```

after running it it gave me this hash:

```0x55b2f6e142e05669921075960226e26b082e7ab588a5c497dcbab5189f79930f```

Which is [here](https://goerli.explorer.zksync.io/tx/0x55b2f6e142e05669921075960226e26b082e7ab588a5c497dcbab5189f79930f#overview) 
on their explorer.

Not gonna lie this is taking a while ðŸ¥µ.

Ok so here was the output: 
```
finalized
result of calling: Henlo
âœ¨  Done in 293.20s.

Nice, so greeting changed from whatever it was to henlo. Henlo ðŸ‘‹
